<h2>Our First Baby Panda</h2>

<p>
On June 25th, we welcomed little Wei Wei who was born 113 grams or a quarter pound. Despite being born the size of a stick of butter, she is perfectly healthy! In fact, they are usually born 1/900th the size of their mother. Despite growing up to 330 pounds as an adult, they are excellent at climbing trees. The birth of little Wei Wei is another sign of the improving panda population. In 2016, after decades of being endangered, the population has grown to improve its status to vulnerable. As we continue rehabilitating the Panda population, we hope for further success in not just the Pandas, but to prevent the extinction and endangerment of many more wonderful species.

<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>Panda’s need to eat 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo everyday to have enough energy.</p>

<h3>How to find Wei Wei</h3>

Unfortunately, because Wei Wei is still nursing, she is unable to be presented to the general public. You can still visit her older brother Yang Yang at Panda Park, located near the north end of the park next to Tundra Town.
