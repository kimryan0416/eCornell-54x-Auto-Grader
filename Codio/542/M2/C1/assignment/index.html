What's New at the Zoo

Tigger at the Safari Park

Meet Tigger! Tigers are an endangered species threatened by poaching,
illegal wildlife trade, and habitat loss. Fortunately, of the subspecies
of tigers, the Bengal Tiger is the most numerous although still
endangered.

Did you know?

Unlike most species in the cat family, tigers love to cool down in and
enjoy water.

How to find Tigger

You can find Tigger and other lions at Tiger Trek, located on the west
side of the zoo, near Jungle Jamboree.

Our First Baby Panda

On June 25th, we welcomed little Wei Wei who was born 113 grams or a
quarter pound. Despite being born the size of a stick of butter, she is
perfectly healthy! In fact, they are usually born 1/900th the size of
their mother. Despite growing up to 330 pounds as an adult, they are
excellent at climbing trees. The birth of little Wei Wei is another sign
of the improving panda population. In 2016, after decades of being
endangered, the population has grown to improve its status to
vulnerable. As we continue rehabilitating the Panda population, we hope
for further success in not just the Pandas, but to prevent the
extinction and endangerment of many more wonderful species.

Did you know?

Panda's need to eat 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo everyday to have enough
energy.

How to find Wei Wei

Unfortunately, because Wei Wei is still nursing, she is unable to be
presented to the general public. You can still visit her older brother
Yang Yang at Panda Park, located near the north end of the park next to
Tundra Town.
