      <p>
        One of our most popular services, we've become quite notorious for our event photography; so much, that we had found a need to develop a separate <a href="events.html">event</a> and <a href="weddings.html">wedding</a> package. Session costs begin from $400 depending on the number of shots, overall session duration, and the number of subjects
      </p>
      <p>
        Our most basic package begins at 50 edited proofs; speak with a consultant to see how much it would cost for your perfect session.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the location is greater than 20 miles distance from the studio, there is an additional cost for travel
