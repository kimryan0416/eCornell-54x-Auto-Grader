    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">How can I get a more accurate pricing for my session?</h2>
      <p>Consultation.</p>
      <p class='hide'>Because almost all sessions are unique and pricing is based on a case-to-case basis, we cannot give you an accurate estimate unless we have met you in a consultation. Consultations are free and commitment-free.</p>

    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">What is a "shot list"?</h2>
      <p>A "shot list" is a list of key people, locations, or situations that should be captured.</p>
      <p class="hide">Although our photographers have extensive experience on how to make the bride and groom shine, we understand that there are specific shots you may want to take. This is not strictly restricted to weddings! Often, event planners need specific shots to show their sponsors, or to advertise for future events. A "shot list" is a list of key people, locations, or situations that should be captured. With the "shot list", we can ensure our clients get the shots they want without fear of running out of time, or forgetting in the busyness of the day.</p>

    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">What do you mean by key guests?</h2>
      <p>We like to provide our clients the opportunity to identify important guests to ensure their inclusion in the photos.</p>
      <p class="hide">We know it takes more than one person to plan and produce an event. We have found that most of our clients like or plan to use our photos on their websites: to advertise or show to their clients and sponsors. To ensure that these key people are included our clients are satisfied, we like to provide our clients the opportunity to identify important guests to ensure their inclusion in the photos.</p>

    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">How does a consultation work?</h2>
      <p>We will have an appropriate consultant call to schedule a 30-min appointment to help plan your event.</p>
      <p class="hide">To ensure we meet the needs of our clients without breaking the bank, the consultation allows us to provide a personalized experience for each photo session where you get as much of what you want at a price you can still afford. Once you send a request for a consultation using our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>, we will have an appropriate consultant call to schedule a 30-min appointment to help plan your event. During the consultation, you and the consultant will discuss your top priorities and build a custom package, if not choose from our set packages, to get as much as you want within your budget. The consultant will then match you to the photographer best fit for your style and availability.</p>

    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">What is the benefit of a in-studio versus a on-location family portrait session?</h2>
      <p>There are pros and cons for both. The better fit depends on what you are looking for.</p>
      <p class='hide'>There are pros and cons for both. The in-studio session allows for a private session with no distractions. We have all of our professional equipment and you have full access to all of our backgrounds and props. With the on-location, you have the ability to capture nature to create beautiful settings a studio cannot artificially replicate. The better fit depends on what you are looking for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h2 class="questions">Do you allow walk-ins?</h2>
      <p>We do not accept walk-ins for sessions.</p>
      <p class="hide">If you are looking for a single portrait photo rather than a full photo session, such as for identification on official documents, we accept walk-ins. To ensure high-quality work, we do not accept walk-ins for sessions as we require a short consultation for theme and cost.</p>
