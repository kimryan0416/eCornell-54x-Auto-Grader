    <h2> Panoramas</h2>
    <div id="photos">
    <p class ="subj-info"> I love taking Panoramas because it
     allows me to capture the full extent
     of what I see, instead of just a small
     snippet.</p>

    <h2>GoPro</h2>

      I take it with me whenever I know there's going to be
      a great nature photo-op! </p>

    <p class = "caption"> The first picture is of a lake called Snow Lake in
      Washington. You can still see the snow on the cliff
      even though this picture was taken in August! The
      second photo is of a sunset on the Gold Coast in
      Australia. The last photo is of Panther Creek Falls,
      located in the Columbia River Gorge right on the border
      between Washington and Oregon.</p>
