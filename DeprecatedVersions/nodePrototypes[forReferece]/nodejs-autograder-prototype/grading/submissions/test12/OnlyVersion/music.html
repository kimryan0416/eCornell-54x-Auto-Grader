<p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> This excerpt shows the outro to the song 514 by Mick Jenkins. This song is from Mick Jenkin's mixtape, "The Waters." What stands out for me in this song is the extended metaphor between the city of Montreal and other escape mechanisms Mick uses to numb the pains of life. </p>

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/75rKK3xyoHM" class="PageVideo ToTheLeft"> </iframe>
  <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> This song is from Joey Bada$$'s latest album ABA, short for All-American Bada$$. I'm particularly a big fan of this album due to the social issues it attempts to tackle through it's lyrics. It tackles these issues in a positive manner, exemplified in this song, Temptation. </p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pu2avDnJy58?start=201" class="PageVideo ToTheRight"> </iframe>
<p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> This excerpt shows the outro to the song Crushed Glass by Freddie Gibbs. This song is from Freddie Gibbs's latest album, "You Only Live 2wice." He released this album after spending nearly a year in prison in Europe after being falsely accused of robbery. In this song he goes into detail about the struggles he went through in prison, and ultimately how he learned who his real friends are. This outro, where he speaks to the importance of "I," really brings home this point. </p>

<p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> This link shows the later half of the song 4 da Squaw off of Isaiah Rashad's latest album, "The Sun's Tirade." The lyrics for this song are harder to folow, but I feel the imagery presented by the linked music video hammers home the main theme of the song, and the album overall. In my mind, it's about how Isaiah has overcome addiction and found solace in his family life. </p>
