    <p>
      A self-loading rifle is a weapon that is capable of semi-automatic or automatic
      fire. While most people think of the M1 Garand when thinking of semi-automatic
      rifles, many prototype semi-automatic rifles were produced by all nations in
      WWI. Though a few were adopted for regular service, most would not see full
      scale production. Although the weapons would have been better at close quarters
      than regular bolt-action rifles, many had trouble with reliability in the
      muddy environments of trenches. This combined with their higher cost ensured
      that they would never replace bolt-action rifles in WWI.

    <h2 class="section">In-Game</h2>
    <p>
      Self-Loading Rifles excel at medium to long range, so keep your distance and
      pick off enemies one by one. Knowing when to engage and when to back off
      is key to succeeding with a self-loading rifle.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      For long range, the M1916 is my choice as it has a high ammo count, making follow up shots easy, good accuracy, and good damage.
      For short range, the Autoloading 8 Extended variant offers the best combination of ammo capacity, fire rate, and damage.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Cei-Rigotti</h3>
    <img src="images/cei_ingame.png" alt="Cei-Rigotti In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Cei-Rigotti?file=Cei-Rigott_IRL.jpg -->
    <p>
      The Cei-Rigotti is the starting self-loading rifle in Battlefield, and like
      most starting weapons it acts as a jack of all trades type of weapon. It comes
      with a generous 10 round capacity, which makes the weapon very forgiving if
      you miss a shot. It also has a very good bullet velocity, which means hitting
      moving targets requires less of a lead. The Cei-Rigotti can also has a fully
      automatic mode, allowing you to compete with submachine guns in a pinch. However,
      the weapon has less than average damage to balance it out. It comes in three
      variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster and has less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has a reflex sight for long range engagements.</li>
      <li>Trench: This variant has better hipfire accuracy, which means its better at close range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/cei_real.jpg" alt="Cei-Rigotti in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Cei-Rigotti?file=Cei-Rigott_IRL.jpg -->
    <p>
      Designed by Colonel Amerigo Cei-Rigotti in the early 1900's, the Cei-Rigotti
      was Italy's first attempt at a self-loading rifle. It was meant to use parts
      from the Carcano, Italy's standard bolt action rifle, but its final design
      had little commonality with the Carcano. Although the rifle was tested by the
      British and Italian armies for adoption, the Cei-Rigotti was ultimately rejected
      for full scale production.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Selbstlader M1916</h3>
    <img src="images/m1916_ingame.png" alt="M1916 In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Selbstlader_M1916 -->
    <p>
      The Selbstlader M1916 is a well balanced self-loading rifle best used at long
      range. Although the 25 round magazine would make one think that this weapon
      is for close range, the weapon is hampered by a slow rate of fire, allowing
      submachine guns and shotguns to rip you apart before you get your second shot
      off. To compensate, the M1916 has good damage and a fast muzzle velocity of 800m/s to
      dominate long range fights. The Selbstlader comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster and has less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has a reflex sight for long range engagements.</li>
      <li>Marksman: This variant has a medium powered scope for very long range engagements.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/m1916_real.jpg" alt="M1916 in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Selbstlader_M1916 -->
    <p>
      The Selbstlader-Karabiner M1916, was the last gun in a series of semi-automatic
      rifles designed by German arms manufacturer Mauser. Although the rifle was
      very accurate, its delicate internal mechanisms were very sensitive to dirt.
      The rifle would then be adopted by the German Air Force, where sensitivity to
      dirt was generally less of an issue. However, the high cost of the weapon and
      the greater number of machine guns available for planes meant that only a
      small number of weapons would be built.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">M1907 SL</h3>
    <img src="images/m1907_ingame.png" alt="M1907 In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/M1907_SL -->
    <p>
      The M1907 SL is a close range self-loading rifle. It features a 20 round magazine
      and very good damage, meaning that it can kill a lot of enemies in quick succession.
      However, high recoil and a low bullet velocity mean that the M1907 SL will
      struggle to hit anything not in close range. The M1907 SL comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster and has less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Trench: This variant has better hipfire accuracy, which means its better at close range.</li>
      <li>Sweeper: This variant adds a fully automatic fire mode, allowing you kill enemies faster in very close range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/m1907_real.jpg" alt="M1907 in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: https://sites.google.com/site/britmilammo/_/rsrc/1374508485991/air-service-wwi-non-303-inch/-351-inch-winchester/RFC2.jpg -->
    <p>
      The M1907 SL is based on the Winchester Model 1907, a semi-automatic rifle
      that was originally designed as a hunting rifle. The weapon would be purchased
      in large quantities after the outbreak in WWI by France, Great Britain, Russia,
      and the US. They were originally used by gunners in aircraft, but as aircraft
      machine guns became more commonplace they were transferred to use by infantry.
      The French especially used it as an assault weapon, adopting a fully automatic
      version in 1917. The rifle would continued to be produced after the war, especially
      by law enforcement.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Mondragon</h3>
    <img src="images/mondrogan_ingame.png" alt="Mondrogan In-Game">
    <!-- Image Souce: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n -->
    <p>
      The Mondrogan is a self-loading rifle that is best used at long range. It does
      good damage, and importantly the damage does not decrease as much as longer ranges
      compared to other rifles. This combined with a muzzle velocity of 800m/s makes
      dropping targets at long ranges easy. However, it has a slow rate of fire making
      it incapable of competing at close range. It comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storm: This variant has less recoil, a good all around choice.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has a reflex sight for medium to long range engagements.</li>
      <li>Sniper: This variant has a high power scope and a bipod for very long range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/mondrogan_real.jpg" alt="Mondrogan in real life">
    <!-- Image Souce: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Mondrag%C3%B3n -->
    <p>
      Developed by Mexican artillery officer General Manuel Mondragón, it was adopted
      by the Mexican army in 1908. This would make Mexico the first country in the
      world to adopt a semi-automatic rifle. 4,000 rifles were ordered from Swiss
      manufacturer SIG. However, the Mexico Revolution of 1910-1920 caused only 400
      rifles to arrive. The German Empire bought the rest of the rifles, but found them
      unsuitable for the dirty conditions of the trenches. They were used on aircraft
      to keep them away from the dirt, but were soon phased out in favor of machine guns.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Autoloading 8</h3>
    <img src="images/auto8_ingame.png" alt="Autoloading 8 In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Autoloading_8 -->
    <p>
      The Autoloading 8 is a unique self-loading rifle. It has a very high rate
      of fire, but only has 5 rounds. As three of these rounds must land to kill
      a full health enemy, the rifle demands a high degree of accuracy from its
      user. The Autoloading 8 is good for small engagements where a player only faces
      one to two enemies, as reloads are frequent with this gun. However, the range
      of the engagement is mostly irrelevant as the Autoloading 8 is good at close and
      long range. The Autoloading 8 has three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster and has less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Marksman: This variant has a medium powered scope for long range engagements.</li>
      <li>Extended: This variant has a 15 round magazine but reduces damage, making it more forgiving
      but making it less powerful against one opponent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">RSC 1917</h3>
    <img src="images/rsc_ingame.png" alt="RSC 1917 In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/RSC_1917 -->
    <p>
      The RSC is a weapon that is best used at medium to long range. Its most defining
      feature is its extremely high damage. It is capable of a two shot kill at close
      range and a three shot kill at long range, more than any other self-loading rifle.
      The RSC also has a decent bullet velocity of 720m/s, and average recoil, so
      good players should be able to land shots on distant enemies. The RSC has
      two variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster and has less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has a reflex sight for medium to long range engagements.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/rsc_real.jpg" alt="RSC 1917 in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/RSC_1917 -->
    <p>
      The RSC M1917, also know as the Fusil Automatique Modèle 1917, was a French
      semi-automatic rifle adopted into service in 1917. Sharing the same cartridge
      as the Lebel, the standard bolt action rifle of France, and many of the same parts,
      the RSC was meant to be an easy to manufacture semi-automatic rifle to supplement
      the Lebel. 86,000 rifles were manufactured, making it one of the first semi-automatic
      rifles issued on a large scale. The rifle was largely forgotten after WWI,
      only used in small numbers in colonial campaigns and WWII.
