      The Maxim Machine gun, invented by Hiram Maxin in 1884, was the first
      practical self-powered machine gun in the world. It was quickly adopted
      by all the major European powers. In WW1, machine guns quickly proved
      their worth by being able to surpress huge numbers of soldiers relatively
      easily. However, these machine guns were very heavy and were mostly used
      in a defensive role. Countries began experimenting with light machine
      guns that could be brought along during an attack to support soldiers
      advancing on trenches.

    <h2 class="section">In-Game</h2>
    <p>
      Used by the Support Class, machine guns have large magazines to provide
      supression and kill large groups of enemies. Supression is dealt by landing
      multiple shots near enemies, which blurs their vision, stops them from regenerating
      health, and increases the sway on their weapons making them more inaccurate.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      For aggressive Support players who like to run and gun, the BAR's high fire rate
      and good hipfire accuracy make it unmatched for that role. The MG15 n.A is
      better for Supports who like to hunker down and provide suppression
      due to its massive magazine size. The Madsen MG offers a balance with good damage, a high fire rate,
      and average capacity.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Lewis Gun</h3>

    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Lewis_Gun -->
    <p>
      The Lewis Gun is a machine gun that is most effective at medium to long range.
      It is the default gun of the support class, and it is a jack of a trades type
      of gun. It has a large magazine size and relatively low recoil, making it good
      at surpressing many enemies at long range. It comes in three different variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low Weight: This variant will  recover from recoil faster and have less recoil overall.</li>
      <li>Supressive: This variant has a larger magazine and an optical sight for increased supression.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has increased accuracy and an optical sight for long range engagements.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/lewisgun_real.jpg" alt="Lewis Gun in Real Life">
    <!-- Image Source: https://www.milsurps.com/content.php?r=448-Lewis-Gun-Love-Affair-(By-Graeme-broadarrow303-Barber) -->
    <p>
      Invented by American Colonel Issac Newton Lewis in 1911, it was adopted by the
      British Army in 1914 after Lewis failed to convince the US Army to adopt it.
      It was first used for vehicles and aircraft, but was then used by infantry
      in 1916 after the older Vickers machine gun proved too heavy. It soon outnumbered
      the Vickers on the Western Front by almost 3:1, mostly because of its portability.
      It would also be briefly used by the US Army, though it much smaller numbers.
      After WWI, it was replaced by the Bren gun, though a few Lewis guns were
      used because of shortages.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">M1909 Benet-Mercie</h3>
    <img src="images/m1909_ingame.png" alt="M1909 In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/M1909_Ben%C3%A9t-Merci%C3%A9?file=M1909%20Benet-Mercie%20Telescopic.png -->
    <p>
      The M1909 is machine gun that is best used at medium to long range. Its damage does
      not drop off as fast as other machine guns, meaning it will retain a four
      shot kill at a longer range than any other machine gun. However like all
      light machine guns continous fire is needed to make the gun accurate. This
      causes issues with the weapons small capacity of 30 rounds, but reloading
      is very quick balancing this out. This weapon has three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storm: This variant has less recoil, a good all around choice.</li>
      <li>Telescopic: This variant has a tripod and a scope, better for very long ranges.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant has a reflex sight and a bipod, good for long range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/m1909_real.png" alt="M1909 in real life">
    <!-- Images Source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Hotchkiss_M1909.png/600px-Hotchkiss_M1909.png -->
    <p>
      The M1909 Benet-Mercie was originally built by the French and known as the
      Mle 1909. It was purchased by the US and is considered to be the US Army's
      first light machine gun. It was first used to fight against Mexican rebel
      and government forces in the Border War of 1910-1919, where it proved to be
      a capable weapon. The M1909 was purchased by countries on both sides of WWI,
      but the limited production meant that they were a rare sight.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Madsen Machine Gun</h3>
    <img src="images/madsen_ingame.png" alt="Madsen In-Game">
    <!-- Images Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Madsen_MG -->
    <p>
      The Madsen is primarily a close range machine gun. It has a good rate of
      fire, hipfire accuracy, and reload speed, which allow it to easily chew
      throught enemies without the need to aim down sights. However, if you try
      to aim down sights the sight itself is very obtrusive, limiting the Madsen's
      long range performance. The Madsen comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low Weight: This variant will recover from recoil faster and has a bipod, making it good for longer ranges.</li>
      <li>Trench: This variant will have better hipfire accuracy, better for close range.</li>
      <li>Storm: This variant will have lower recoil, a good choice for any range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/madsen_real.jpg" alt="Madsen in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://modernfirearms.net/userfiles/images/machine/mg64/madsen_1896.jpg -->
    <p>
      The Madsen machine gun is a Danish machine gun designed in 1896. It was an
      expensive because of it sophisicated design, but its reliability made it worth
      its price. It was first used in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 by the
      Imperial Russian Army, and was purchased by many more countries after that.
      Before and after WWI, 34 countries would purchase the Madsen, and it would
      see service well into the 50's.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">MG 15 n.A</h3>
    <img src="images/mg15_ingame.png" alt="MG15 n.A In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/MG15_n.A. -->
    <p>
      The MG 15 n.A's main strength is its huge capacity. Starting with 100 rounds
      in a magazine, it can surpress huge groups of enemies for a long time. It
      also has the fastest muzzle velocity of any machine gun, requiring less
      of a lead for distant targets. However, these strenghs are balanced by
      low damage, requiring a lot of bullets to land to drop someone. The gun
      also overheats after firing 30 round continuously, so make sure to use
      bursts. The MG 15 n.A has 3 variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low Weight: This variant will  recover from recoil faster and has a bipod, making it good for longer ranges.</li>
      <li>Storm: This variant has lower recoil and no bipod, better for aggresive play.</li>
      <li>Surpressive: This variant increases the capacity to 200 and adds a bipod and reflex sight, allowing you to deploy
      and lay torrents of withering fire.</li>
      </ul>
    <img src="images/mg15_real.jpg" alt="MG15 n.A in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/MG15_n.A. -->
    <p>
      The MG15 n.A was the German answer to the British Lewis gun after the infamous
      Battle of the Somme. Realizing they had no counter to the Lewis Gun, the
      Germans took the MG15, a heavy water cooled gun and lightened it to make
      the MG15 n.A. Unfortunately, the MG15 n.A would be overshadowed by the
      MG 08/15, the light machine gun version of the MG 08 heavy machin gun. The
      MG15 n.A would mostly be used by German soldiers assisting the Ottoman
      Empire, and would largely be forgotten by WWII.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">BAR 1918</h3>
    <img src="images/bar_ingame.png" alt="BAR In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/BAR_M1918#Battlefield_1 -->
    <p>
      The BAR 1918 is the machine gun most suited for close range. It has an
      extremely fast rate of fire and good damage, allowing it to tear through
      enemies. This combined with good hipfire accuracy makes the BAR a monster
      in close quarters. However, the BAR's main weakness is its capacity of only
      20 rounds, meaning that taking down more than two enemies will usually require
      a reload. However, reloads are quite quick. The BAR has three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trench: This variant improves hipfire accuracy, better for close range fights.</li>
      <li>Storm: This variant decreases recoil, better for medium range.</li>
      <li>Telescopic: This variant adds a bipod and a scope for picking off enemies at long range.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/bar_real.jpg" alt="BAR in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://www.forgottenweapons.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/m1918bar-01.jpg -->
    <p>
      Standing for Browning Automatic Rifle, the BAR was America's answer to a
      need for a light machine gun. Meant to support an infantry attack, the BAR
      was meant to implement a concept known as walking fire, where the weapon
      would be fired from the hip while hanging from a specialized shoulder strap.
      In reality, it would be used like a traditional light machine gun, fired
      from a bipod mounted on the ground. Although it would arrive very late in
      WWI, it would be the US's standard squad machine gun in WWII for the entire
      war and would see service even up to Vietnam.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Huot Automatic</h3>
    <img src="images/huot_ingame.png" alt="Hout In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Huot_Automatic -->
    <p>
      Similar to the Lewis Gun, the Huot Automatic is a jack of all trades light
      machine gun. However, the Huot is more accurate than the Lewis, but also
      has less capacity and a lower rate of fire. To maximize your performance
      stay at long range and take your shots carefully. The Huot has two
      variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low Weight: This variant recovers from recoil faster.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant adds a reflex sight and has slightly better accuracy to
      make long range shooting easier.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/huot_real.jpg" alt="Huot in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Huot_Automatic -->
    <p>
      An automatic conversion of the Canadian Ross rifle after it was withdrawn
      from frontline service, the Huot Automatic Rifle was intended as Canada's
      light machine gun. Copying the cooling system of the Lewis Gun and adding
      a 25 round magazine, the Huot was popular with troops testing it in France,
      and was slated for full production. Unfortunately, the war ended before
      any guns could reach Europe.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Chauchat</h3>
    <img src="images/chauchat_ingame.png" alt="Chauchat In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Chauchat -->
    <p>
      The Chauchat is a unique light machine gun, mostly because of its incredible
      damage. It is capable of a three shot kill, the only machine gun capable
      of doing so. However, this is balanced by its extremely slow rate of fire
      of only 360 rounds per minute. To use this gun effectively you'll want to
      stay at a short to medium range to take advantage of the high damage,
      since at both very close and long range rate of fire is the most important
      factor in victory and the Chauchat's sluggish rate of fire will leave
      you outgunned. The Chauchat comes in two variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low Weight: This variant recovers from recoil faster.</li>
      <li>Telescopic: This variant adds a scope to assist with long range firefights.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/chauchat_real.jpg" alt="Chauchat in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://www.mitrailleuse.fr/France/Chauchat/chauchat.jpg -->
    <p>
      The Chauchat, developed as far back as 1903, was adopted in 1915 as France's
      light machine gun. France had realized that its troops needed a weapon that
      could provide automatic fire and was light enough to be carried by one man in an attack.
      Unfortunately, it quickly gained an infamous reputation for unreliability in the muddy
      conditions of trench warfare. These failures usually stemmed from the
      Chauchat's unique half-moon magazine. It was open on one side to
      allow soldiers to see how many rounds they had left, but this also allowed
      dirt to enter and clog up the gun. The Americans especially hated the gun,
      as the Chauchats converted to American calibers often jammed after a few
      rounds due to differences in the amount of powder between French and American
      cartridges. However, the weapon was light compared to other light machine
      guns, and was inexpensive to produce, allowing the French to equip
      two armies with them. In the end, the Chauchat was a flawed weapon, but it was important
      in helping develop the infantry assault tactics that are used today.
