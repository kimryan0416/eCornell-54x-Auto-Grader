      Shotguns had existed for many years before World War 1. They have been a
      favorite of hunters, highway robbers, and law enforcement since the late
      1700's. The military mostly abandoned using them as their limited
      range made them inferior to ordinary rifles. However, in the late 1800's,
      John Browning revolutionized the weapon by developing the pump action
      system that most modern shotguns will use. These designs gave shotguns
      a new lease on life in WW1. The cramped conditions of trenches in addition
      to the high rates of fire allowed by the pump action design made
      shotguns weapons to be feared. They were so effective that the German
      government tried to have the weapons banned claiming they violated the
      Hague Convention of 1907 by causing "unessesary suffering". These protests
      fell mostly on deaf ears.

    <h2 class="section">In-Game</h2>
    <p>
      Used by the Assault class shotguns are by far the most powerful close
      quarter weapons in Battlefield 1. They do enormous damage at close range
      and because of the spread of the buckshot they fire perfect aim is not
      always required. However, damage drops off quickly so avoid long
      range engagements.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      Amongst the shotguns, the Model 10-A Hunter variant is currently the reigning champion as its raw damage is
      unmatched. The Hunter variant also allows the shotgun to be competitive at long ranges.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">M97 Trench Gun</h3>
    <img src="images/m97_ingame.png" alt="IngameM97">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/M97_Trench_Gun -->
    <p>
      The M97 is a shotgun that is specialized for close range. It also has a
      special feature in that it can be fired continously by holding down the fire
      button. This makes it extremely good at clearly buildings or tunnels. It has good
      damange as well, capable of a one shot kill if all pellets land. It
      stikes a balance between the slow firing Model 10-A and the lower damage semiautomatic shotguns.
      It comes in three different variants.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backbored: This variant decreases recoil and the time it takes to
      recover from recoil.</li>
      <li>Hunter: This variant decreases spread, making the shotgun more accurate at
      long range but making it harder to use up close.</li>
      <li>Sweeper: This variant adds more pellets and increases the spread of the gun,
      but also has less damage per pellet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The M97 was designed by American weapons designer John Browning, and was
    the primary shotgun used by the US Army for WW1, WW2, and even Korea and Vietnam.
    It was unique in that a design quirk allowed to be fired repeatedly by simply pumping
    the action. This allowed it the be fired extremely quickly, which proved deadly
    in trench warfare, earning it the nickname "trench sweeper". It caused protests
    from the German government, although the US mostly ignored them. Skilled trap shooters could even
    use the M97 to shoot grenades out of the air to protect their allies.</p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Model 10-A</h3>
    <img src="images/10A_ingame.png" alt="10A In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Model_10-A?file=Model_10-A_Factory.png -->
    <p>
      The Model 10-A is shotgun that focuses on pure damage. It does the most
      damage per shell of any shotgun and can often kill in one shot even to
      medium range. It also has the highest capacity of any shotgun with 6 shells.
      However, it is also the slowest firing shotgun in the game so make your
      shots count. Try to pick off single enemies rather than rushing at multiple enemies.
      It comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster. </li>
      <li>Hunter: This variant tightens up the spread, giving it better long range
      performance but making it less forgiving at close range.</li>
      <li>Slug: This variant uses slugs instead of shells, giving it raw damage for
      medium range combat but losing any spread whatsoever. It also has an reflex sight.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Designed by John Pedersen as a civilian sporting shotgun, it was adopted
      by the U.S Army to suppement the M97 trench gun that was already in service.
      It was modified with a bayonet lug as well as a wooden heat shield on the
      barrel, something not depicted in game. Although it did not see as much
      military use as the M97, it did see civilian success after the war.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">12g Automatic</h3>
    <img src="images/12g_ingame.png" alt="12g Automatic In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/12g_Automatic -->
    <p>
      The 12g Automatic is a semi-automatic shotgun that specializes in close
      range combat. Being semi-automatic, it has an extremely high rate of fire,
      higher than both the pump action shotguns. It also has extremely controllable
      recoil, making it very easy to spam fire the 5 shells the shotgun has. However,
      it doesn't do as much damage as other shotguns, so being able to land each shot
      is a necessity. It comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backbored: This variant has less recoil and recovers from it faster.</li>
      <li>Hunter: This variant tightens up the spread, giving it better long range
      performance but making it less forgiving at close range.</li>
      <li>Extended: This variant holds 7 shells instead of 5.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/12g_real.jpg" alt="12g Automatic in real life">

    <p>
      The Browning Automatic 5 was designed by famous American gun maker John
      Browning and was one of the first successful semi-automatic shotgun designs.
      A favorite of police and sport shooters, it was used by the military in
      limited numbers from WWI to Vietnam. The Auto 5 would be produced from 1902
      all the way up to 2000, a testament to its quality.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Sjögren Inertial</h3>
    <img src="images/Sjögren_ingame.png" alt="Sjögren In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Sj%C3%B6gren_Inertial -->
    <p>
      Acting as a compromise of the damage of the pump-action shotguns and the
      rate of fire of the 12g Automatic, the Sjögren Inertial is a semi-automatic
      shotgun that is best used at short to medium range. It is capable of a one
      shot kill at close range like the pump action shotguns, and has controllable
      recoil, making it a flexible weapon. It has no variants to compare.
    </p>
    <img src="images/Sjögren_real.jpg" alt="Sjögren in real life">

    <p>
      Designed by Carl Axel Theodor Sjögren in the early 1900's, it used a unique
      inertia operated system to cycle the action. This system would later be used
      in modern shotguns like the Benelli M4. Around 5,000 were produced before WW1,
      and they saw limited use in WWI by all sides. However, they are very rare
      in the present day, most of the surviving copies probably owned as trophies.
