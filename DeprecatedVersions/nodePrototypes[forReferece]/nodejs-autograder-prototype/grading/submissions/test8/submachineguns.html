      World War 1 saw the debut of submachine guns. Recognizing that the full
      sized rifles that most soldiers were equipped with were unwieldly in the
      close quarters fighting of trench warfare, nations began experimenting with
      high capacity pistols. These eventually developed into fully automatic weapons,
      and thus the submachine gun was born. Submachine guns would come to be associated
      the infiltration tactics in the laters years of WWI, especially those of
      German stormtroopers.

    <h2 class="section">In-Game</h2>
    <p>
      Submachine guns are used by the assualt class for short to mid-range combat.
      Use them to clear out tight spaces like trenches or buildings.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section">Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      The Hellriegel 1915 has the best combination of recoil, magazine size, and damage of the submachine guns.
      The Automatico M1918 is also good on maps with lots of close quarters.
    </p>

    <h3 class="weapontitle">MP18</h3>
    <img src="images/MP18_ingame.png" alt="MP18 In-Game">

    <p>
      The MP18 is the default submachine guns, and like default weapons it fills a
      jack of a trades role in the submachinegun class. It has low recoil, making
      it easy to handle for middle ranges but a low rate of fire means it usually
      can't compete at close range with other submachine guns or shotgus. It also has
      very good hip-firing accuracy, it a very consistent and forgiving weapon. It
      comes in three variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trench: This variant has greater hipfire accuracy for close quarters.</li>
      <li>Optical: This variant gives you a red dot sight to make aimimg at distance targets easier.</li>
      <li>Experimental: This variant change the gun to a three round burst, giving it greater recoil control
      and accuracy but a slower rate of fire and a longer reload.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/MP18_real.jpg" alt="MP18 in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP_18 -->
    <p class = "weapondescription">
      The first practical submachine to be used in large numbers, the MP18 was
      the developed from German efforts to make fully automatic pistols. These
      efforts failed due the light weight of pistols making fully automatic fire
      virtually impossible due to recoil. A full sized weapon was needed, as thus
      the MP18 was born. The MP18 was used extensively in the final stages of the
      war, mostly by German stormtroopers. The MP18's portability and firepower
      made it perfect for their fast-paced and close quarters engagements. The
      MP18 would go on to influence later German submachine guns like the MP28 and MP34.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Automatico M1918</h3>
    <img src="images/automatico_ingame.png" alt="Automatico In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/battlefield/images/9/9d/Automatico_M1918_Factory.png/revision/latest?cb=20161108051932 -->
    <p>
      The Automatico M1918 is the submachine specialized in close quarters firefights.
      This is mostly due to its unparalleled firerate of 900 rounds per minute which kills enemies
      within a few seconds. This combined with a quick reload time makes it easy to
      mow through enemy squads if you can sneak up on them. However, the Automatico
      has a lot of recoil because of this fire rate, so using it at long range is
      much more difficult. The Automatico has three variants:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Factory: This variant recovers from recoil faster, making it a good all around choice.</li>
        <li>Trench: This variant has greater hipfire accuracy, making aiming unnecessary for close range.</li>
        <li>Storm: This variant has less recoil, improving long range performace.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The M1918 was an Italian weapon made by Beretta in 1918. It was based on
      the Villar-Perosa, an earlier Italian aircraft gun that fired pistol rounds.
      It borrowed the top loading magazine design from the Villar-Perosa, using
      gravity and not a spring to push rounds into the gun. According to some sources
      it predates the MP18, making it the first true submachine gun in the world.
      However, much fewer of them were produced, though a few did see action in WWII.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Hellriegel 1915</h3>
    <img src="images/hellriegel_ingame.png" alt="Hellriegel In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Hellriegel_1915 -->
    <p>
      The Hellriegel's defining feature is it's large magazine of 60 rounds. This
      makes it a forgiving weapon as missing a few shots is not a big deal. This
      capacity combined with a decent rate of fire makes it a powerful weapon up close.
      It also makes the Hellriegel very good with flanking since it has enough
      rounds to kill up to 13 players. However, it has a moderate amount of recoil
      limiting its long range performance. Players also have to watch out for overheating,
      which occurs after firing 40 rounds. The Hellriegel has 2 variants:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Factory: This variant has lower recoil, making it better at long range.</li>
        <li>Defensive: This variant has a 120 round magazine and a bipod, making it
        better at laying down surpression from a fixed position.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The Standsch√ºtze Hellriegel 1915 was a prototype water cooled submachine gun
      made by Austria-Hungary in 1915. No complete examples survived to the present
      day, and the gun only has two pictures depicting it, so not much is know about
      its internal mechanisms. Interestingly, these pictures show the drum magazine
      being seperate from the gun, not attached. Had the Austro-Hungarians
      pursued the design, it probably would have been the first submachine gun
      ever fielded.

    <h3 class="weapontitle">Ribeyrolles 1918</h3>
    <img src="images/ribeyrolles_ingame.png" alt="Ribeyrolles In-Game">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Ribeyrolles_1918 -->
    <p>
      The Ribeyrolles is the game's long range submachine gun. It has good damage,
      muzzle velocity, and low recoil, making it very good at taking out distant
      enemies. It also has a bipod that eliminates most recoil when the gun is
      propped on a surface. However, it is weak at close range due to it's lower
      rate of fire and poor hipfire accuracy. Stay at long ranges to maximize
      your performance with this weapon. The Ribeyrolles only has one variant,
      so there are no comparisons.
    </p>
    <img src="images/ribeyrolles_real.jpg" alt="RibeyRolles in real life">
    <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Ribeyrolles_1918 -->
    <p>
      The Ribeyrolles 1918 was technically not a submachine gun. In fact it could
      qualify as one of the first assault rifles in the world, more than 30 years before
      the Stg44 or AK-47. It used an intermediate cartridge, the 8x35mm, fed from a
      25 round magazine, and was equipped with a bipod, suggesting an intended role
      as a light machine gun rather than an assault rifle. However, it was eventually
      abandoned over logistical issues regarding the brand new cartridge and concerns that
      the intermediate round was too weak for the light machine gun role it
      was intended for. A weapon that arrived too early for its time, had it been
      developed further it could have revolutionized infantry combat like the Stg44 did.
