  <p>As someone who was raised in New York City, I had always thought of
    anything beyond Westchester as a midde-of-nowhere, rural upstate that
    doesn't have much to offer for me. Boy I was wrong.</p>
  <p>There is a lot more to New York State outside of our cities. And every
    year, the town of Ithaca hosts the <strong>Apple Harvest Festival; this year
    from September 30th to October 2nd.</strong> After years of helping my
    friends and families plan out their trip out to Ithaca for an amazing
    weekend, I've come to realize that my resources can come in handy for many
    New Yorkeres. From expected vendors, events, to accomodations, this website
    should come in handy when planning your trip up to Ithaca from the city.
    Enjoy!</p>
