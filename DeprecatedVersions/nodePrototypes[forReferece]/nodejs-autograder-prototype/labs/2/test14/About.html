      <h2>About the Festival</h2>
      <div>
        <p>This year, Tompkins County celebrates the 35th Annual Apple Harvest Festival on September 29 (Friday, 12 - 6pm),
          September 30 (Saturday, 10am - 6pm), and October 1 (Sunday, 10am - 6pm).
          In past years, the festival, only consisting of three days, has attracted over 35,000 visitors.
          The Apple Harvest Festival, colloquially known as "Apple Fest," is known for its delicious desserts,
          drinks, and treats that incorporate apples among other foods into them. Whether you are looking
          to try one of the many variations of apples or you just want to participate in one of Ithaca's
          most highly anticipated events of the year, Apple Fest is the place for you.</p>
          <p>Apple Fest is celebrated by people of all age groups and interests. Each year students from all
            grade levels and the surrounding universities come out to socialize and enjoy the treats the festival
            has to offer. Ithaca's Apple Fest is the perfect way to begin or end your weekend. Whether you
            go with family, friends, or date, Apple Fest is great way to connect with the community and indulge
            in apple-related treats and more!</p>
            <p>Each year, the Festival seeks to offer a diverse range of vendors for festival goers.
              This means you will be able to find apples, apple pies, apple cider, candied apples, and more!
              Although the festival is known for its creative uses of apples, vendors also sell other goods
              such as sweet potato pies, macaroni and cheese, and hamburgers. Regardless of your feelings
              towards apples, there will be something that you will enjoy at the festival. We look forward
              to seeing you there this fall!</p>
