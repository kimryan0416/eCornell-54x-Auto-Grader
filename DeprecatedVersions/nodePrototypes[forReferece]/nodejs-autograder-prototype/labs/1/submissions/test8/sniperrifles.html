  <p>
    Although snipers had existed before, World War 1 was the first use of scoped
    sniper rifles on a large scale. At the start of the war, only Imperial
    Germany possessed scoped rifles due to their ability to manufacture high
    quality lenses. However, the French and British quickly started training
    their own snipers in 1915 and equipping them with scopes as well. Snipers
    either used a scope attached directly to their rifles or used a seperate
    periscope to stay concealed in a trench.

  <h2 class="section">In-Game</h2>
  <p>
    Used by the Scout class, these rifles have long range and
    good accuracy to eliminate targets from afar. Players have
    the option to equip a scope or use the iron sights. Rifles
    also have a sweet spot, or a range where the rifle will kill
    in one hit to the body, incentivizing players to stay within
    this range.
  </p>

  <h2 class="section">Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
    For long range, the Gewehr 98 is probably the best as its bullet velocity makes long range shooting incredibly easy.
    For a more objective based sniper, the SMLE Mk. III has an ideal sweet spot and high capacity, making it a good choice.
    The Martini-Henry is a good choice for aggressive players with very good aim.

  <h3 class="weapontitle">Lebel 1886</h3>
  <img class = "bigimage" src="images/lebel_ingame.png" alt="Lebel In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/battlefield/images/1/1e/BF1_Lebel_Model_1886.png/revision/latest?cb=20170315032444 -->
  <p>
    The Lebel is a sniper rifle that is in the middle of other rifles like the MKIII
    or the Springfield. It's one shot kill ranges from 50m to 87m, which allows
    for playing near the objective while still being at a safe distance. It also
    has a capacity of 8 rounds, and has a relatively high rate of fire as well,
    allowing you to take down multiple enemies quickly. Its greatest weakness is
    its extremely long reload, so be sure to find a safe spot before trying.
    It has two variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variant uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil quicker, making it better for close range.</li>
    <li>Sniper: This variant comes with a high powered scope and a bipod, making it better at very long range.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/lebel_real.jpg" alt="Lebel Real Life">
  <!-- Image Source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Lebel_Model_1886.jpg -->
  <p class="weapondescription">
    Introduced as the standard infantry rifle of France in 1886, the Lebel was revolutionary
    because it was the first standard rifle to use smokeless power. It also held 8
    rounds in an underbarrel tublar magazine, giving it greater capacity than any other
    rifle of the day. Its adoption started an arms race with Germany, which was forced
    to adopt a new rifle to counter the Lebel. The French had planned to replace
    the Lebel in 1913, but the threat of war forced it stop and stick with the more
    numerous Lebel. In combat, the old tubular magazine proved to be the rifle's greatest
    weakness. Although the Lebel had a high capacity, it was very awkward and slow
    to reload in combat as it could not use a stripper clip like other rifles of the day.
    The rifle was ultimately replaced after the war by the MAS-36, though shortages
    meant that the Lebel would still see service even in WWII.
  </p>

  <h3 class="weapontitle">SMLE Mk. III</h3>
  <img src="images/smle_ingame.png" alt="SMLE In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/SMLE_MKIII -->
  <p>
    The SMLE Mk. III is the sniper rifle for players who want to be aggressive.
    It's sweet spot is goes from 40-75 meters, one of the closest in-game. This
    incentivizes players to stay close to objectives rather than camp halfway across
    the map. The SMLE is unique in that holds 10 rounds, the most of any sniper
    rifle, allowing you to focus on shooting and not on your ammo count. This
    combined with the fact that non-scoped variants can fire continuously when
    aimed down sights makes the SMLE fearsome at close to medium range. The
    SMLE comes in three variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variants uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil faster.</li>
    <li>Marksman: This variant comes with a medium powered scope for long range sniping.</li>
    <li>Carbine: This variant adds a reflex sight and is more accurate when moving for medium
      range shooting.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Image Source: http://www.vmaleather.com/.cm4all/iproc.php/LE_Wood/SMLE_MkIII.jpg/downsize_1280_0/SMLE_MkIII.jpg -->
  <p>
    The SMLE Mk III, standing for Short Magazine Lee-Enfield, was the most recent
    version of the Lee-Enfield rifle when World War One broke out. It quickly
    gained a reputation for being a fearsome battle rifle capable of laying unending
    volleys of fire thanks too its 10-round magazine. It was also very fast firing,
    and British soldiers were training to perform the mad minute, where 20-30 rounds
    were firing in 60 seconds. There are even stories of German soldiers mistaking
    the fire from Lee-Enfields with that of machine guns. The Lee-Enfield would go
    on to serve in WWII and beyond, though it was modified again as the SMLE No. 4
    Mk I.

  <h3 class="weapontitle">Gewehr 98</h3>
  <img src="images/gewehr_ingame.png" alt="Gewehr 98 In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Gewehr_98 -->
  <p>
    The Gewehr 98 is one of two bolt action rifles in the game that specializes
    in long range combat. Its sweet spot ranges from 80-125m, the second furthest
    of all sniper rifles. It's defining feature is its bullet velocity of 880m/s,
    which is the highest in the whole game. This bullet velocity makes shooting at
    long ranges very easy, as leading the target becomes almost unnecessary. However,
    the Gewehr also has a slow rate of fire which could allow enemies to kill you
    as you cycle the bolt, so be sure to be in cover between shots. The Gewehr 98 comes
    in three variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variants uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil faster.</li>
    <li>Marksman: This variant comes with a medium powered scope for long range sniping.</li>
    <li>Sniper: This variant comes with a high powered scope and a bipod, making it better at
      very long range.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/gewehr_real.jpg" alt="Gewehr 98 in real life">
  <!-- Image Source: https://www.milsurps.com/content.php?r=219-1916-Gewehr-98-Rifle-(Mfg-by-Spandau) -->
  <p>
    Designed by the German arms manufacturer Mauser, the Gewehr 98 is one of the
    most famous rifles ever made. This is mostly because of the action of the rifle,
    which allows to gun to fire high powered rounds safely, made the rifle
    extremely accurate, and were very durable. This part of the gun has been copied
    in many other weapons, like the American Springfield and the Japanese Arisaka,
    and even in modern bolt action rifles. It was replaced in WWII by the Karabiner 98k, a shortened
    version of the Gewehr 98. However, the original rifle still sees some use as
    a hunting rifle.

  <h3 class="weapontitle">Gewehr M.95</h3>
  <img src="images/m95_ingame.png" alt="M.95 In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Gewehr_M._95 -->
  <p>
    The Gewehr M.95 is unique amongst the sniper rifles in that it does not have a
    sweet spot, meaning it is impossible to get a one shot kill to the body. It also has
    as slow bullet velocity of only 620m/s. While this may make the weapon sound
    useless, the M.95 has two advantages to make up for this. The first is its
    incredibly high rate of fire of 67 rounds per minute, one of the highest of
    all the sniper rifles. The second is the fact that the gun can be fired
    continuously when aiming down sights for all variants, allowing you to keep
    track of your target if you miss. These advantages make the M.95 a forgiving
    close quarters weapon. The M.95 also has a quick reload that does not change
    depending on how many bullets you have left, meaning that you can quickly
    reload after killing an enemy and be ready for the next. The M.95 has three variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variants uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil faster.</li>
    <li>Marksman: This variant comes with a medium powered scope for medium range sniping.</li>
    <li>Carbine: This variant adds a reflex sight, is more accurate when moving, and has better
    hipfire accuracy.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/m95_real.jpeg" alt="M.95 in real life">

  <p>
    The M1895 was an Austro-Hungarian weapon designed by Ferdinand Ritter von
    Mannlicher. It was unique due to its straight pull bolt, which would be operated
    faster that the standard bolts used by virtually ever other rifle in the war.
    However the straight pull bolt required more care than a regular bolt due to
    its mechanical complexity. It also used an en-bloc clip rather than a stripper
    clip. This meant that the clip and all five rounds had to be inserted at once,
    with no option to load rounds one at a time. After the war and collapse of the
    Austro-Hungarian Empire, most of the rifles were sold to the Balkan states,
    where they would see use in WWII.

  <h3 class="weapontitle">Russian 1895</h3>
  <img src="images/1895_ingame.png" alt="Russian 1895 In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Russian_1895 -->
  <p>
    The Russian 1895 is a sniper rifle best used in medium range. It has a sweet
    spot which ranges from 60-100m, putting it in the middle of the pack. It also
    has a fast fire rate with its lever action, though not as fast as the M.95.
    The rifle also has a fast bullet velocity of 820m/s making long range shooting
    easier. However, the reload of the 1895 is pretty sluggish, so make sure that
    you find cover before doing so. The Russian 1895 comes in three variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variant uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil faster.</li>
    <li>Sniper: This variant comes with a high powered scope and a bipod, making it better at
      very long range. </li>
    <li>Trench: This variant has no sweet spot, but increases rate of fire and hipfire accuracy
      to make it a better close quarters weapon similar to the M.95.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Winchester 1895 was a lever action rifle and a descendant of the famous
    Winchester Model 1873, the gun associated with the wild west. It was the first
    Winchester rifle that used an internal box magazine that could be reloaded with
    stripper clips, as opposed to the tube magazine of older Winchester rifles. The
    Russian Empire, short on weapons to equip their vast armies, purchased 300,000
    rifles and converted them to Russian calibers. There would account for 70% of all
    1895's produced, the rest sold to the US Army or as hunting rifles.

  <h3 class="weapontitle">M1903 Springfield</h3>
  <img src="images/m1903_ingame.png" alt="M1903 In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/M1903_Springfield -->
  <p>
    The M1903 is the sniper rifle used for extreme long range shooting. It has the
    furthest sweet spot of any rifle with it ranging from 100-150m, a very generous distance.
    It also has a very fast muzzle velocity of 820m/s, making leading those long
    range shots a little easier. The M1903 is also unique in that it also suffers
    from less bullet drag, which means that bullets will maintain their velocity
    to a further range than any other gun, further aiding with long range shooting.
    The M1903 comes in three different variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental: This variant changes the M1903 into a semiautomatic rifle with reduced damage
      but a high rate of fire.</li>
    <li>Marksman: This variant comes with a medium powered scope for medium to long range sniping.</li>
    <li>Sniper: This variant comes with a high powered scope and a bipod, making it better at
      very long range.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/m1903_real.jpg" alt="M1903 in real life">
  <!-- Image Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1903_Springfield -->
  <p>
    The M1903 Springfield was created in response to the Spanish-American War,
    when the US realized that their Krag-Jorgenson rifle was severly outgunned.
    Studying the M1893 Mausers that gave them so much trouble, they developed the
    M1903 Springfield that borrowed from the Mauser design and the old Krag Jorgenson
    design. It was the US Army's main service rifle in WWI, and would continue to see
    action in WWII as a sniper rifle and as the service rifle of the Marine Corps.
    It would continue to serve as a sniper well into the Vietnam War.
  </p>

  <h3 class="weapontitle">Martini-Henry</h3>
  <img src="images/martini_ingame.png" alt="Martini-Henry In-Game">
  <!-- Image Source: http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/Martini-Henry -->
  <p>
    The Martini-Henry has several unique features, which make it one of the strangest
    sniper rifles in game. This most noticable feature is its capacity; it only holds
    one round and must reload after firing it. This makes good aim extremely important.
    In addition, the muzzle velocity is the slowest of all sniper rifles at a paltry
    440m/s, requiring one to lead even medium range targets. However, these flaws are
    balanced out by the Martini-Henry's defining characteristic: its damage. From 42-68m
    from your target it will do a 112 damage, meaning that even hitting the arms or legs
    of your target will result in an instant kill. From 68-80m, it will perform like
    a normal sniper rifle sweet spot. Because of these feature, the Martini-Henry should
    be used at close range to take advantage of the enormous damage, but is very
    unforgiving if a shot is missed. The Martini-Henry has two variants:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Infantry: This variant uses the iron sights and recovers from recoil faster.</li>
    <li>Sniper: This variant comes with a high powered scope and a bipod, making it better at
      very long range.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="images/martini_real.jpg" alt="Martini-Henry in real life">
  <!-- Image Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martini%E2%80%93Henry -->
  <p>
    Entering service in 1871, the Martini-Henry was the rifle commonly associated
    with late British imperialism. It served in the First Boer War, the Second
    Anglo-Afghan War, and most famously in the Anglo-Zulu War where it features in
    movies like Zulu from 1964. As it came before the 1886 Lebel, it still used
    black powder to propel its massive .577 caliber round. Though its heyday had passed
    by WWI, it was still used in the African and Middle Eastern fronts. Amazing, some
    working rifles have been found by US soldiers as late as 2010.
