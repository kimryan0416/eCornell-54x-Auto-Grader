<p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> Goran Dragic is a Slovenian basketball player currently in the NBA. I first became a fan of his when he was a backup point guard for the Phoenix Suns. In a playoff game he came in and went off for 23 points in a quarter, demonstrating his brazen confidence and ability to dominate a game. </p>

<p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> John Stockton is the best point guard to play the game in my opinion. He was a true floor general. And he also happened to dedicate his life to my favorite basketball team. </p>

<p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> There is no reason why I should be a Utah Jazz fan as a New Yorker. But I like the fact that they are based in a small market and are commited to developing their players. </p>

<p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> In Europe instead of sports franchises their are sports clubs. Sports clubs can field teams in a variety of sports. Fenerbahce is an example of this, and I am a huge fan of the sports club, and therefore a fan of their soccer and basketball teams. </p>
