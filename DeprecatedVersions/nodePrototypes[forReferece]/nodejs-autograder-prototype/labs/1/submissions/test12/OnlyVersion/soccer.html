  <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> Alex de Souza is a player I grew up watching on my favorite soccer team, Fenerbahce. He is a legend for the team and has a statue in Istanbul, for great reason. He was a one of a kind talent. Not the most athletic player by any means, he could control a game with his vision and awareness. His technical skills are also superb, developed by his days playing futsal in Brazil. </p>

  <p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> Zidane is a player that any soccer fan is aware of. His last game of soccer ever was marked in controversy, but that couldn't take away from the outstanding career he had. He was the definition of a number 10, which in soccer is the player that sets the pace and flow of the game. He dominated the midfield with his mind, using his superior awareness and ball skills to simply outclass opponents.</p>

  <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> Fenerbahce has been my favorite soccer team since I was a little kid. My fandom has deteriorated in recent years, but I will still watch their games as a fan. What makes them a good team to follow is the passion and dedication of their fans. However, this is also a reason to be turned off to them as the fans can be violent and reckless at times. </p>

  <p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> Ajax is a Dutch team that is known for the talent that has gone through their academy system. They have also been very succesful in Europe. Starting in the 60s, their players revolutionized the game of soccer. </p>
