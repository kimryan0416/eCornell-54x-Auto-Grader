    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JN5sqSEXxm4" class="PageVideo ToTheLeft"> </iframe>
    <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> This scene is one of my favorite scence's from the movie. Ralph Fiennes' acting as M. Gustave really shines as he delivers the line "Somone's been murder, and you think I've done it." This line and him subsequently running from the police are a great example of the incongruent style of humor in the movie. Also, the camera movements in this scene are typical Wes Anderson, which I think make his movies very good at story-telling. </p>

    <p class="Explanation ToTheRight"> This scene demonstrates the one major thing that separates Interstellar from other movies. And that is its visuals. Director Christopher Nolan's ambitious project to show scientific phenomenon that are loosely understood on the big screen paid dividends as this movie won many awards for its visuals. I was lucky enough to watch the movie in IMAX 3D, and it was the best movie theater experience I've ever had. </p>

    <p class="MinorHeader ToTheLeft"> Donny's Funeral </p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wk61MeDmk2M" class="PageVideo ToTheLeft"> </iframe>
    <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> This scene demonstrates the absurdist humor present in the movie The Big Lebowski. The Coen brothers are known for their witty writing and humor styles, and in my opinion none of their movies demonstrate this better than The Big Lebowski. There's no real plot to this movie, there's just laughs. </p>

    <h5 class="Movies ToTheLeft"> In Bruges </h5>
    <!-- Tower Scene-->

    <p class="MinorHeader ToTheLeft"> Tower Scene </p>
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FohzGNEDegQ" class="PageVideo ToTheLeft"> </iframe>
    <p class="Explanation ToTheLeft"> In Bruges is a dark comedy that excels at its use of subtle humor. This scene where the main antagonist of the film, Harry, attempts to use the tower for murder and is stopped by a Belgian officer who is profoundly devoted to his job is a great example of this. The scene subtly references that the tower is closed because someone experienced a heart attack climbing the stairs the other day, referencing a previous scene in the movie where the main characters warn an overweight family not to try to climb the tower. </p>
